## Deliverables

To get full points you only have to complete all of the levels. They build on top of each other as you go.

For all 3 levels use the code in `starter.py` to start.

### Level 1

Create the user profile page. This page should:

- Take in a username and find the corresponding user (i.e. `localhost:5000/user/@descent098` should get the user with descent098 as username)
- Parse the data of a user including:
  - Username
  - Real name
  - Profile picture
  - Bio
  - List of posts
    - Post picture (if it has one)
    - Post title
    - Post description

The starter code is available at `/templates/user.jinja`, and the starter function can be found in `routes.py` and is called `profile_page()`

### Level 2

Create a discover page. This page should:

- List all users and give you links to their profiles
- Create a "topic" link for different topics. When people click on the link they should only get the profiles with those topics specified

Before you can do this you will need to create a "topics" field for each user that is an array of items.

### Level 3

Create an account pages, and create post pages:

- Create an account page where people sign up with:
  - a **unique** username
  - A name
  - Topics 
  - profile picture
  - Bio
- A page to create posts
  - Optional image
  - Title
  - Description
