# Articles

This week we covered lots about text, images and formatting. One place that has all of these is articles/blog posts. So your task will be to do some work on 2 different blog posts, 1 for an animal/wildlife blog, and 1 for a coding blog.

## Deliverables

To get full points complete level 2 and level 3

### Level 1

This level just has plain text, and you are working towards styling it.

- Style all paragraph and heading tags
  - Use `font-family`, `line-height` and any other CSS properties to make the text look nice
- Make use of margin and padding as we discussed during the session
  - Your content should be centered on the page, and have nice spacing

### Level 2

This level includes images and unordered lists. It is the same layout otherwise as level 1, so you can transfer the same style tag if you started there.

- Style all paragraph and heading tags
  - Use `font-family`, `line-height`, `font-weight` (try bold for heading elements) and any other CSS properties to make the text look nice
- Style all anchor tags
  - On top of normal text formatting, also include a colour that is easy to read for the links
  - (OPTIONAL): Look into [pseudo classes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Pseudo-classes), we will cover these next week. Specifically take a look at `:hover` and `:visited`
- Make use of margin and padding as we discussed during the session
  - Your content should be centered on the page, and have nice spacing
- Style your images
  - They should be a more reasonable width and height
  - They should feature `border-radius` to make the edges a bit rounder

### Level 3

**You must complete level 2 as well for level 3 to count for points!**

You have been given a blog post for a coding site. The company has hired you to redesign the site in a dark theme. 

- Use one of the colour schemes discussed during the session as the background color
- Change all of the text colours to complement the new background colour
- You will see a `<pre>` and `<code>` element these are for showing off code. Add a slightly lighter background to these code examples, and try using `border-radius` to make them stand out. **OPTIONALLY** you can change the colour a bit to make them stand out more
  - `<pre>` is like a paragraph tag, but it respects spacing. Which is handy for languages like python
  - `<code>` is used to deliniate the inner content is code
