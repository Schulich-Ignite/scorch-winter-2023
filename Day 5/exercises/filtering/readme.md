## Hints

### Installing

To install the code remember some of the ways we can do paths. We've mostly done URL's, but think about how you would use file paths in any other language!

### Filtering

Keep in mind "animals" in this case would be replaced with the plural name (s at end), and they are the outer element that directly houses of the inner elements that will be filtered (the posts). Think about how this compares to bootstrap, what elements with what classes would be the ones that hold another group of elements (our card exercises).
