## About Us

The One in a Chameleon is a one stop shop for any scaley friend you could ever want or need. We've got turtles, lizards, frogs and more, and we can't wait to set you up with your forever friend.

Operating out of Picture Butte, Alberta (where we're the main tourist attraction!), the One in a Chameleon adoption society and shelter is able to ship Canada wide on a number of our friends. If you'd like to bring home one of our larger inhabitants, you'll need to come and visit us in person.

**LEGAL DISCLAIMER:** One in a Chameleon is NOT responsible for any reprecussions that may come from owning a less than legal pet under provincial wildlife acts. Special licensces and exemptions may be required to legally own or obtain some of our animals, and believe us when we say that we will not be checking. 


## Currently Adoptable Friends

> **Wilma** | She may be old, but she's just as goofy as ever! Wilma is a 90 year old tortoise who absolutely loves her belly rubs... you just might have to help her back up after.

> **SIR FREDRICK THE 23rd** | Like his father before him, and grandfather before him and... (you get the idea) Sir Fredrick the salamander was dubbed a knight of Italy in the early 2010 for his service to the Italian republic, and he's now looking for a new family to serve!

> **Señorita Frog** | Though not as successful as her brother, Señorita Frog also used to work in the restaurant business, until several healthcode violations and unpaid labour scandals saw her business go bankrupt. Lucky for you, she can't wait to find her new forever home after her house was forclosed!

> **Alan** | Alan is a perfectly sweet aligator, who most definetly does NOT have any current lawsuits against him for biting off the French delegates baby toe at the last annual international reptile expo. He looks super friendly, we promise (from a safe distance of 6-10 ft away).
