# King!

A band (King!) has approached you to build them a website. Using what you learned about bootstrap, getting images, and design create them a site that meets their goals.

## Primary goals

- Help them get info out to fans
- An authoratative place to link their social medias

## Design requests

- a dark colour theme
- yellow/gold or red accents
- Navigation menu with links to each page of the site
- A hero image or banner on the homepage featuring the band or a promotional image (see https://unsplash.com for images but others are included)
- A responsive layout that works well on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices
- Integration with the band's social media accounts (Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, etc.)

## Sites they like

- [Home - Hozier](https://hozier.com/)

- [Neon Thunderbird](https://neonthunderbird.com/)

- [Tyler Childers Official Online Store (tylerchildersmusic.com)](https://tylerchildersmusic.com/)

- [band](https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/tryw3css_templates_band.htm)

## Deliverables

To get full points you **only** have to complete 1. If you complete more than 1, only the highest level will count!

### Notes

- Any links (like social media), can just go to the site homepage (i.e. https://twitter.com for twitter)
- You **must** use bootstrap, but you can add additional CSS
  - Additional CSS Tips:
    - You can use negative values for margins to stack elements on top of each other. For example negative `margin-top` values on text can help you put it over images
    - `bg-black` and `bg-dark` classes can be used to set the background colours, and `text-white` or `text-light` classes can be used for the text colours
    - If you have a `div` you can use the css style [background](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css3_pr_background.php) to change the background to a color, change it to an image, and change how the image shows up. For regular images you can use `background: url(images/<filename>);background-size:cover;` to set the background of the div to an image that will scale with screen size.

### Level 1

A coming soon page for an album from the band

- A landing page that is a "coming soon" page for one of the albums in the content section
  - Include social media links somehow (footer, sign up for newsletter form etc.)
  - Include a/some image/images of their concerts to build up hype

### Level 2

A single page for the band that talks about them and their work

- A landing page that
  - introduces the band
    - Talk about bandmates
  - Talk about their albums
  - Talk about their awards

### Level 3

- A landing page that just introduces the band and has links off to the other pages
- A "about the band" page with
  - Some stock photos of people or performances
  - Talk about the bandmates 
  - Their albums
  - Their awards
- A contact page
  - A contact form for fans to reach out to the band directly (doesn't need to work, just need the HTML to see what it looks like)
  - Contact information (see content section below)
- A footer with copyright information and additional links to social media on **all pages**
- A navbar with links to the other pages that is displayed on **all pages**
