# Coder!

It's your first day on the job, and you just got an email from your boss

```
Hey There, 

Welcome to the team! You'll be taking over from the old guy... dave I think, or maybe Darrel, not sure. Anways we have a few tasks for you to complete today.

It looks like there's a couple bugs we need resovled, and we need you to implement some features.

Our last guy walked out without any information, so you're gonna have to figure it out yourself! I've attached details below with what we need you to do. If you have any questions... Google them, because I don't know what to do.

Thanks,
Mike

## Blog Filtering

So we added a new post about using powershell, but we have no idea how to add a new language to the filters. The old guy just did it for us before he left. Take a look at our blog page and try to figure out how to add `powershell` as a language, and how to add the `Making PowerShell More Bash-ful` story to that filter

## Blog highlighting

Inside the blog post `Making PowerShell More Bash-ful` none of the syntax highlighting is working. We need you to do 2 things:

1. Make the highlighting work for bat/cmd/dos
2. Make the highlighting work for powershell
3. Change the theme to nord

## Create-a-page

Last guy got some stuff working:

- Headings
- Lists
- Paragraphs
- Code
- Delimiter

So there's still:

- Tables
- Quotes
- checklists

To do, pick one and get it working. Old guy said you should only need to change extractDatatoHTML()
